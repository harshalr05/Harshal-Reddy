    <h1> First Project <h1>
    <img src = "images/hangman_projectpic.PNG" height="500" alt="hangman_projectpic" class = "center">
    <h1> We made Hangman with Python. We pretty much used a list with fruits and randomized it. Then, we created a body, head, arms, and legs with def. After this we made a guesses counter using a while loop. Then with the guesses we used if statements to call in the body, head, arms, and legs when needed. We also used elif to display the letters that are inputed.<h1>

    <h1> This is my second python project!</h1>
    <img src = "images/memorygame.PNG" height="500" alt="hangman_projectpic" class = "center">    
    <h1> We made a memory card game using many different variables. We used different pictures for the cards. We tried to keep it as show or movie characters. We created animations in a different websites, then stitched the pictures together to create a flipping like animation. Then we made a timer and leaderbaord. Lastly, we made circles so that the cards can be clicked and used if and elif statements to make sure the cards matched.</h1>
    <h1>   scratch project.</h1>
    <img src = "images/tour.PNG" height="500" alt="hangman_projectpic" class = "center">
<h1> We made a game using scratch. We made a tour of france. We used procedures to make the person walk and when it touched the edge of the screen it switched backgrounds. When you play you have to hold the right arrow until it touches the edge. We also added music along with the famous places in France.<h1>

	<h1> 3.1.6 Project</h1>
    <h1>   We guessed that it was desert plains. This is because we thought that the chart with the spike near the end was the temperature which would explain the lower temperatures that heat up quickly during the daytime. We also thought that the graph that constantly went up and down was the sound chart. This would explain the constant chitter and buzzing. Then the light was the one that stayed high because it said high ambient light. Lastly, the movement was fairly constant and we thought that because of constant winds that vary with regularity.</h1>

    <h1> The picture above is of the medium honey producers. We used data from various places and found statistics for different things. For example, the picture above is of the medium honey producers. </h1>

    <h1>We used the gaslab second law simulation. It was very interesting and in this simulation it simulates the 2nd law of thermodynamics with the behavior of gas particles in a box. The turtles represent the gas particles. </h1>
